# Character-Browser
Overwatch Character Browser Project
This project was for CSCI 130 (Web Development) at Fresno State. 
It is a web based browser that stores, edits, deletes, sorts, and displays data about Overwatch character from a MySQL Database. 
This project untilized HTML, CSS, JavasScript, PHP, and SQL languages.

To view this project, you need install the contents in a folder within XAMPP->HTDOCS. 
First you need to edit the connectDB.php with your MySQL user credentials. 
After starting Apache and MySQL, you can then open initialize_databse.php within your browser to initialize your DB with the JSON file. 
Once that is complete you can open the web browser by going through localhost/folderyoucreated. 
Then use the buttons to edit, create, delete, and sort the movies and navigate through the characters.
